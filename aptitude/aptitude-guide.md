## 1. Quantitative Aptitude

### A. Number System

**Key Concepts:**
- Natural Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
- Whole Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
- Integers: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...
- Rational Numbers: Numbers that can be expressed as p/q where q ≠ 0
- Prime Numbers: Numbers divisible only by 1 and themselves
- Composite Numbers: Numbers with more than two factors

**Important Properties:**
- Divisibility Rules for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11
- LCM × HCF = Product of two numbers
- Sum of first n natural numbers = n(n+1)/2
- Sum of first n odd numbers = n²

**Practice Questions:**
1. Find the HCF of 18, 24, and 36.
   **Answer:** 6 (Common factors: 1, 2, 3, 6)

2. What is the LCM of 15, 20, and 25?
   **Answer:** 300 (15 = 3×5, 20 = 2²×5, 25 = 5²; LCM = 2²×3×5² = 300)

### B. Percentages

**Key Formulas:**
- Percentage = (Part/Whole) × 100
- Increase % = (New Value - Old Value)/Old Value × 100
- Decrease % = (Old Value - New Value)/Old Value × 100
- Successive percentage changes: If two changes of a% and b% occur, net change = a + b + (ab/100)

**Practice Questions:**
1. A number is increased by 20% and then decreased by 15%. What is the net change?
   **Answer:** Net change = 20 + (-15) + (20×(-15)/100) = 5 - 3 = 2% increase

2. If 60% of a number is 240, what is 25% of that number?
   **Answer:** Number = 240/0.60 = 400; 25% of 400 = 100

### C. Profit and Loss

**Key Formulas:**
- Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
- Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price
- Profit% = (Profit/Cost Price) × 100
- Loss% = (Loss/Cost Price) × 100
- SP = CP × (100 + Profit%)/100
- CP = SP × 100/(100 + Profit%)

**Practice Questions:**
1. A shopkeeper bought an item for ₹800 and sold it for ₹920. Find the profit percentage.
   **Answer:** Profit = 920 - 800 = ₹120; Profit% = (120/800) × 100 = 15%

2. An article is sold at 25% profit. If the cost price is ₹1200, find the selling price.
   **Answer:** SP = 1200 × (100 + 25)/100 = 1200 × 1.25 = ₹1500

### D. Simple and Compound Interest

**Simple Interest (SI):**
- SI = (P × R × T)/100
- Amount = P + SI
- P = Principal, R = Rate, T = Time

**Compound Interest (CI):**
- CI = P(1 + R/100)^T - P
- Amount = P(1 + R/100)^T

**Practice Questions:**
1. Find SI on ₹5000 at 8% per annum for 3 years.
   **Answer:** SI = (5000 × 8 × 3)/100 = ₹1200

2. Find CI on ₹10000 at 10% per annum for 2 years.
   **Answer:** CI = 10000(1 + 10/100)² - 10000 = 10000(1.1)² - 10000 = 12100 - 10000 = ₹2100

### E. Time and Work

**Key Concepts:**
- If A can do work in 'a' days, A's one day work = 1/a
- If A and B together can do work in 'c' days, (A+B)'s one day work = 1/c
- If A's one day work = 1/a and B's one day work = 1/b, then together they can complete work in ab/(a+b) days

**Practice Questions:**
1. A can do a work in 10 days, B can do it in 15 days. How long will they take together?
   **Answer:** Combined work = 1/10 + 1/15 = 3/30 + 2/30 = 5/30 = 1/6; Time = 6 days

2. A and B together can do a work in 12 days. A alone can do it in 20 days. In how many days can B alone do it?
   **Answer:** B's work = 1/12 - 1/20 = 5/60 - 3/60 = 2/60 = 1/30; B alone = 30 days

### F. Time, Speed, and Distance

**Key Formulas:**
- Speed = Distance/Time
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Time = Distance/Speed
- Average Speed = Total Distance/Total Time
- Relative Speed (same direction) = |S₁ - S₂|
- Relative Speed (opposite direction) = S₁ + S₂

**Practice Questions:**
1. A car travels 240 km in 4 hours. What is its speed?
   **Answer:** Speed = 240/4 = 60 km/h

2. Two trains 150m and 100m long are moving in opposite directions at 60 km/h and 40 km/h. Time to cross each other?
   **Answer:** Relative speed = 60 + 40 = 100 km/h = 100 × 5/18 = 250/9 m/s
   Total distance = 150 + 100 = 250m; Time = 250 ÷ (250/9) = 9 seconds

2. Find next term: B, F, J, N, ?
   **Answer:** R (Gap of 3 letters each time)

### E. Syllogisms

**Rules:**
